# CV_Virtual_Cursor

## Topic : Virtual Cursor using Hand and Eye Detection

Aim : To develop a computer vision-based gesture recognition system that enables users to control a
virtual cursor using hand and eye movements, enhancing human-computer interaction.

**Short Summary :**

1. This project allows users to control their computerâ€™s mouse, media playback, and volume using hand gestures and face tracking. It uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and pynput to detect hand movements, facial landmarks, and simulate keyboard/mouse actions.
   
**2. Functionalities & Their Implementation**
   
      Move the mouse using the index finger.
   
      Left-click when index & middle fingers are close together.

      Double Click Fast repeated clicks when fingers are close.
   
      Right-click when only the thumb is up.
   
      Scroll up/down using the pinky and ring fingers.

      Adjust volume based on head movement (nose Y-coordinate).
   
      Pause media if eyes are not detected for a certain time.
   
      Sleep the screen if eyes are not detected for too long.
   
**3. Requirements**
   
      OpenCV (cv2)
   
      MediaPipe (mediapipe)
   
      pynput (pynput.mouse)
   
      NumPy (numpy)

**4. Applications**

      Gaming and Virtual Reality (VR)

      Augmented Reality (AR) and Smart Displays

      Assistive Technology

      Security and Authentication
